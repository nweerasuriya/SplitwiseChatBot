# SplitwiseChatBot
A LLM chatbot built using LangGraph and connected to Anthropic's Claude model. This chatbot connects to the Splitwise expense sharing application that can answer questions by using RAG to retrieve relevant Splitwise expenses.
The application can be run locally using streamlit and the app.py file. A cloud hosting solution will be developed in the future.
